Development of the new Townsville Jazz Club website will begin.

All files are to be managed and version controlled via Github, begin by pulling files from the repository
and preparing to link them to a local Wordpress development setup, using your preferred hypervisor such as Docker or Vagrant and your preferred IDE such as VSCode or PhpStorm.
In our group, we had different local setups for running WordPress. This was on account of the fact that each person had a different computer, and therefore had different requirements.
   One hypervisor that was used was Mamp. Mamp was doenloaded from https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/  
   After that, the surver was set up, wordpress was installed, and the website was created.
   Docker was also used.
