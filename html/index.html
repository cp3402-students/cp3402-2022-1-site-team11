            One of the aims of the Club is the identification and development
            of younger musicians interested in playing jazz music.    
            To this end the Club has begun hosting a Junior Jammers evening, 
            basically every second Friday evening, at the Lounge Bar of the 
            Sugar Shaker (Grand Chancellor Hotel) from 6pm to 9pm. There is a 
            door charge of $10 pp (cash only).
