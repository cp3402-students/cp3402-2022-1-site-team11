<h1>Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band</h1>
<p>PMJB is to the best of our knowledge Queensland's longest running jazz band and was founded in February 
    1974.</p>
    <ul><h3>Original members of the band were:</h3>
    <li>Jan Aleman – Guitar</li>
    <li>Larry Thomson – Trombone</li>
    <li>Paul Waters – Clarinet</li>
    <li>Ivan Hauri – Clarinet</li>
    <li>Luke Portier – Bass</li>
    <li>Bob Hebden – Drums</li>
    <li>Les Nicholson – Trumpet</li>
    </ul>
<p>In 1975 not long after starting John Ruffle and Nev Minon joined the band and Bob Passmore and Red 
    Huxley joined around 1985.
    <br><br>
    In 1978 PMJB recorded the first ever locally recorded and produced vinyl album engineered by Eric 
    Ball. PMJB has recorded on ABC radio with Gospel singer Shereen Malamoo and in 1982 had its own 
    three-show jazz series on Channel 7 Television titled Front Line Jazz.
    <br><br>
    PMJB has appeared at Festivals all over Queensland and appeared at the Australian Jazz Festival in 1978.
    <br><br>
    The band's music style supports its name and the music ranges from early Trad, to mainstream, to 
    swing with a hint of modern.
    <br><br>
    The band’s motto is take the music seriously but not yourself.
    <br><br>
    John, Nev, Red, Bob (Passmore) and Les are still in the band which plays on the 4th Sunday of each 
    month as the house band for the Townsville Jazz Club.</p>
