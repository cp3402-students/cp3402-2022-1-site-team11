<h1>Type A Personality Jazz Ensemble</h1>
<p>Type A Personality Jazz describes a musical ensemble comprised of confident band leaders with big 
    personalities (no one here mentioned egos did they?).  
    <br><br>
    The original group consisted of Larry Thomson on keyboard, Les Nicholson on trumpet, Bob Passmore on 
    bass, Justin Cataldo on drums, David Salisbury on sax and vocalist Vicki Salisbury.  Each of these 
    players heads up their own musical group from Cataldo's The Kitchen to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band 
    founded by Les;  Vicki and the Captain in Captain Nemo and Bob's Counterpoint, Magnetic Views for 
    Larry as well as the various other bands many of us have been involved with.  Obviously the A-Type 
    brand was the perfect fit for this crew!  
    <br><br>
    The group was formed in 2011 and has performed at the Townsville Jazz Club, Magnetic Island's Tropical 
    Jazz Party, Townsville JazzFest, the Jezzine Barracks launch and various gigs here and there.

    The composition of Type A Personality Jazz changes with availability of players, however what does not 
    change is the ethos the group was founded on,  our mutual passion for jazz and loving the spotlight.</p>
