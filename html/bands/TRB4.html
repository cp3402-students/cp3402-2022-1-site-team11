<h1>TRB4 (The Reg Braun Four</h1>
<p>
    The story so far by Reg Braun...
    <br><br>
    TRB4 formed in early 2010. My old mate, Bob Passmore, suspected that Gavin Forno (bass guitar), 
    Rebecca McHutchison (saxophone & vocals), Mark Wyer (piano) and myself (drums) might sound good 
    together. Our first gig confirmed the wisdom of Bob’s discerning ears. We ‘clicked’ right from the 
    start. We’d thrown around all sorts of names for our ensemble and finally settled on TRB4, in time 
    for the 2010 Palmer Street Jazz Festival.

    We all play with many other groups and bring those experiences with us to TRB4. This synthesises 
    into unique musical performances using all the colours on the palette as we collaborate for the 
    greater good of the music.

    Rebecca’s smouldering ballads can stand the hair up on the back of your neck. Mark’s piano has a 
    glorious elegance. His technical brilliance is balanced with spaciousness and nuance. Gavin’s bass 
    can lure us into funkier territory. There’s always new ways to interpret the old standards. As well 
    as foot stomping swing we like to explore playing softly and slowly, exploring the nuance of the song. 
    We all particularly enjoy Latin rhythms. On brushes mallets or sticks, I play with both the lyric and 
    the music in mind as I create a rhythmic framework under the other musicians. As American jazz drummer 
    Shelly Manne once said: “we never play a tune the same way once”
