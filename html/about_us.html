 
Presentation (10%) 
Your group must record a 7-10 minute video demonstration and justification of your chosen development and deployment workflow. Your group will research, test, decide on and use a modern process for collaborative development and deployment considering best-practice issues such as project management, version control, testing and automation. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a significant part of modern development processes (devops). This is not just about getting your site online but rather about learning valuable skills for in-demand job roles. 
You will use this workflow for developing your WordPress site and theme, then present the process and your analysis and justification of it (pros and cons, insights learned). In your analysis, discuss multiple options that you considered and tried and describe why you chose your final process. That is, you cannot just describe what one thing you did; you must test and evaluate multiple options. 
Note that your presentation is NOT about designing your actual site, the client, etc. – just the workflow. 
Format: 
Record and submit your presentation as a video file. If it is longer than 10 minutes, re-do it. Use something that allows you to present both your screen and cameras so we can see each person as they speak as well as the visuals. In keeping with the philosophy of the subject, you are welcome to use whatever you wish. Zoom or Google Hangouts can be good for this. In the past some students created excellent presentations using Discord and OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). 
Every member of your group must participate and talk (ideally fairly equally) in the presentation. 
A key part of your presentation is a live demonstration of how you can update your site theme in a local environment, use appropriate version control, and efficiently update a live site. This should include both theme code and database content, and include staging and production. Make sure you prepare a realistic (not “blah blah”) change to demonstrate... and practise it!
