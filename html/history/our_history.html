    <h1>Townsville Jazz Club INC.</h1>
    <p>The Townsville Jazz Club was originally established as the NQ Jazz Club and operated under this 
        name for approximately 18 years when the management committee began to question whether the 
        regional name of ‘North Queensland’ that did not clearly inform people where the jazz club was 
        actually based was not assisting new people to locate the club.  
        <br><br>
        In this age of electronic searches to find recreational activities, it was felt that most new 
        residents and people travelling through Townsville who were searching for jazz venues would 
        include jazz and Townsville in their search regardless of any other keywords that they may use 
        in their search.                  
        <br><br>
        At the 2011 Annual General Meeting a proposal was made to change the name of the club to 
        Townsville Jazz Club Inc. to better reflect the physical location of the club. This motion was 
        passed and the official change of name took place on 11 January 2012.</p>

<h2>2012 - A year of Change and Growth</h2>
<p>The club’s website that had been operating since 2006 was changed to reflect the new name and a 
    Townsville Jazz Club Inc. facebook page was established on 21 January 2012.
    <br><br>
    On Sunday 24th June 2012 more than half the club’s members were present for the launch of the new 
    Townsville Jazz Club Inc. logo featuring Neville Minon.  This was a memorable night when we paid 
    tribute to Nev for his 62 years of service to both jazz and brass band music.  With such a 
    distinguished musical career I don’t think anyone would begrudge Nev the honour of gracing the 
    Townsville Jazz Club logo.  It was clear that Nev was very touched by the occasion and he and his 
    wife Christine were delighted with the image that was created through Bob Spillane’s photography and 
    the artistry of Katrina Cataldo at Townprint.  
    <br><br>
    By the time of the AGM in November 2012 the club had increased its non-member attendance by 69% over 
    the previous year which the committee agreed was heavily influenced by the combination of the change 
    of name and a concerted effort to promote the club through electronic media.
    <br><br>
    The Townsville Jazz Club has continued to shape its program to reflect the style of jazz that attracts 
    the majority of its members (mostly swing and trad jazz), lots of theme nights with patrons encouraged 
    to dress in the fashions of that era, with occasional evenings of modern jazz.  The club still 
    encourages bands to play jazz that people can dance to as the most of the members either like to dance 
    or are happy to watch other people dancing whilst still enjoying the music from their chair.  
    <br><br>
    A further development for the club was the introduction of a Facebook page in 2013. This has been 
    steadily expanding people’s awareness of the Townsville Jazz Club and has helped to encourage new 
    people to attend.  
    <br><br>
    As we begin the 2015 jazz year with the Opening Night being held on 8th February, the Townsville Jazz 
    Club has a well-planned program for the year, a hard-working dedicated committee and a membership base 
    that loves jazz and fully support their local musicians.  What more could a club want...</p>
