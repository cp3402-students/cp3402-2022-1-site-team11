<h1>Junior Jazz</h1>
<h2>1997 – 2008 North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc.</h2>
<p>Although North Queensland Junior Jazz Inc. was a not a NQ Jazz Club program and operated independently, 
    there was a positive rapport between the two organizations and a willingness by the NQ Jazz Club’s 
    committee to support the aim of Junior Jazz. It is therefore appropriate that Junior Jazz be given 
    the recognition it deserves on the NQ Jazz Club website.
    <br><br>
    The Junior Jazz concept was initiated by Brian Lane who was then ably supported by jazz musicians
    Les Nicholson, Peter Martin and Bob Passmore.
    <br><br>
    From 1997 to 2007 Junior Jazz provided an annual opportunity for high school jazz bands to perform 
    before an audience, including a panel of professional jazz musicians, and to be adjudicated on their 
    performance. This was not a competition but an assessment of each band’s performance against several 
    criteria with feedback given personally to each band leader.

    When Junior Jazz started this was perhaps the only opportunity for school bands to demonstrate their 
    interest, understanding and competence in the jazz genre and enthusiasm to take part was very high. 
    One year a record 17 schools took part including bands travelling from Mackay, Charters Towers, Ayr 
    and Ingham as well as several from Townsville. This fantastic participation rate was in no doubt due 
    to the concerted liaison with schools conducted by Junior Jazz President, Brian Lane.  As the school 
    music programs gained momentum, students had multiple performance options and Junior Jazz numbers 
    declined until the organisers decided to wind up the North Queensland Junior Jazz Festival 
    Organization Inc. in 2008. The Directors of Junior Jazz unanimously voted to disperse the remaining 
    Junior Jazz funds to  the NQ Jazz Club Inc. subject to the terms and conditions listed in a Memorandum 
    of Understanding signed on 25th July 2008. The sum of $2,412.50 was transferred to the NQ Jazz Club on 
    28th July 2008 and has been used in accordance with the Memorandum and reported in the Treasurer’s 
    Reports each year since that time.</p>
