<h1>Harbour End Jazz Club</h1>
<p>Whilst jazz music had been played in Townsville long before the Harbour End Jazz Club was formed in 1980, 
    there had not been a recognised venue where jazz was performed for about twenty years.  This club 
    effectively started the revival of the jazz scene in Townsville which was then carried on with the 
    formation of the North Queensland Jazz Club (NQ Jazz Club Inc. from 1995) and its subsequent change 
    of name to Townsville Jazz Club Inc. in 2012.
    <br><br>
    The Harbour End Jazz Club was started in 1980 by Mo Murakami, Ted Redknap, Bob Hebden and Les Nicholson.
    Ted and Mo were members of the widely acclaimed North Qld Area Army Band.  The Army band had a close 
    association with the local musicians and having Ted and Mo as Directors cemented that close 
    relationship.  Mo also had an input into starting the NQ Jazz Club which still exists today 
    and is a significant institution in the promotion of jazz in Townsville.  
    <br><br>
    The club met on every second Thursday at the then Tattersalls Hotel (Tatts) in a back room that was 
    small but very intimate, the ideal jazz club.  Crowds were phenomenal and there was not enough room 
    to raise your arm to drink your beer.  The room spilled out to a beer garden which thankfully provided 
    some space.  Brian Fitzimmons and his wife Pat ran Tatts and were very supportive of the club.
    <br><br>
    Brian and Pat also ran jazz in the beer garden on Saturday afternoons which provided work for the local 
    bands.  Great musos such as Billy Laut, Ross Collins, Kanga Yoman and Franz Condie were regulars.  
    All were ex Sydney musos who had come north to get away from the rat race.
    <br><br>
    Going to the jazz club at Tatts was always a great night.  The club became a place to be on the 
    social scene and many friendships were formed which have lasted for 30 plus years.  Over its life 
    the club had some famous Australian musicians who appeared including the Bob Barnard Jazz Band which 
    included John Macarthy, Chris Tapperel, Johnny Costello, Len Barnard and Whally Wickham.  Don Burrows 
    also played at the club as did Nth Qld legends like Junior See Poy and his wife Ann and Paul Zammit.
    <br><br>
    The club ran for many years and held two major Jazz Festivals in 1981 and 1983.  Sheila Keefe, a 
    then Townsville City Council Alderman, was instrumental in assisting with the 1983 festival and 
    was the patron of the club.
    <br><br>
    The Pacific Mainstream Jazz Band (PMJB) was the house band at the club which in those days had a 
    line-up of Ivan Hauri (clarinet), Luke Portier (bass), John Ruffle (piano), Bob Hebden (drums), 
    Nev Minon (trombone) and Les Nicholson (trumpet).  Paul Waters on clarinet was also a member of 
    PMJB at various stages.
    <br><br>
    On the 23rd  February 2014 PMJB celebrated its 40th birthday at the Townsville Jazz Club and at 
    that time Les, Bob, John and Nev were still current band members.
    <br><br>
    The club folded in 1990 due to several factors, arguably the most significant being the demise of 
    the Nth Qld Area Army Band.  This decision by the Government of the time was very contentious and 
    caused a vociferous outcry from members of the Townsville Community.
    <br><br>
    For ten years the Harbour End Jazz Club was one of the ‘in’ places in the Townsville music scene and 
    made a great contribution to the Townsville Arts and Music Community. </p>

    <h1>NQ Jazz Club INC.</h1>
    <p>The formation of the North Queensland Jazz Club began with discussions led by Brian Linforth, 
        Mo Murakami and Andrew Dajski around 1993.  By 1994 these guys were playing once a month for 
        ‘beer money’ just to get the club started however the club Newsletter from 1999 states that on 
        Sunday 11th April the club celebrated its fourth birthday and indicates the official start of 
        North Queensland Jazz Club being 7th April 1995.  Bands appearing in this formative era included 
        Andrew’s band Downtown Dixie, Nobby Nielsen from Cairns, Les Nicholson’s Pacific Mainstream Jazz
         Band and other groups of musos who regularly played together in un-named bands. Brian Linforth 
         was the inaugural President and the club became incorporated on the 22nd July 1997 and adopted 
         the official name of NQ Jazz Club Inc.
        <br><br>
        The original logo for the NQ Jazz Club Inc. was designed and drawn by Bob Hebden and depicted a 
        trumpet-playing, bowler-hatted face in the sun overlooking Castle Hill.
        <br><br>
        In April 1998 three foundation members, Andrew Dajski, Brian Linforth and Mo Murakami (now deceased) 
        were appointed as Life Members of the club.
        <br><br>
        1998 was also the year that the NQ Jazz Club fully supported the decision by a small independent 
        group, Les Nicholson, Bob Passmore, Peter Martin and Brian Lane (then president of the NQ Jazz Club), 
        that the time was right to run an activity to encourage high school students to appreciate and play 
        jazz.  Whilst this was not a jazz club event Nth Qld Junior Jazz Festival Inc. was promoted through 
        the NQ Jazz Club until the final festival was held in 2007 and the remaining funds were transferred 
        to the NQ Jazz Club on the 25th June 2008.   
        <br><br>
        Like many other jazz clubs it was a struggle to find an appropriate venue and the first gig to gauge 
        public interest was held in the Sovereign Hotel in Flinders Street.   Over the next four years the 
        club’s jazz nights were held in the Exchange Hotel, The Crown Hotel, the Royal Hotel, the Rugby League 
        Club in Redpath Street and then the Kirwan Function Centre until September 1998.
        <br><br>
        The NQ Jazz Club then moved to its first ideal venue, the German Australian Club in Aitken Street, 
        Aitkenvale on 25th October 1998 where it stayed until the building was put on the market December 
        2008.  The committee could not be assured of having secure accommodation for the full year so another 
        venue had to be found.  The club moved to its current location at the Townsville PCYC, Wellington 
        Street, Aitkenvale for the start of the 2009 year.
        <br><br>
        The club would not have become established and continued to operate had it not been for many dedicated 
        voluntary committee members who gave their time freely to help manage a successful jazz club.  
        Whilst it’s not possible to nasme all committee members club records show the following people have 
        filled the President’s role since the first AGM in 1995:

            <li>2020 - Now - Bob Passmore</li>
        </ul>
       
        <br><br>
        In 2006 Albert Schimmel started a website to promote jazz music featuring the Jazz Program on 4TTT 
        Radio and the NQ Jazz Club.  This website is still being managed by Albert with regular updates to 
        the Program page and a selection of photos taken at almost every jazz night each year.  This 
        facility has continued to be a great promotional tool for the club with traffic increasing every year.
        <br><br>
        The committee of 2008 introduced some ‘feature’ nights to give members a selling point to entice 
        new people to attend in an effort to increase attendance numbers that had been dwindling for a 
        few years.  The first of these special evenings would be held close to ANZAC Day featuring music 
        from the war era and a jazz ball with Stokes Nicholson Big Band as the drawcard.  Pacific 
        Mainstream Jazz Band offered to present the ANZAC-themed night and a very successful Come in 
        Spinner night with 93 attending was held on 27th April.  Cinderella’s Jazz Ball was held on 13th 
        September, the name reflecting that this was a mini-ball and guests would all be home before 
        midnight!  This was a way to hold a shorter-duration ball at a lower, more competitive ticket 
        price than other balls then being held in Townsville.  The night was a huge success with 103 
        people in attendance!
        <br><br>
        Up until this year a different band played at each jazz gig but as musicians moved away from 
        Townsville, drifted to other more lucrative styles of music or retired from playing in bands 
        the club constantly struggled to set a program in advance, not knowing which band would be 
        available. This was not popular with patrons as the club had some members who liked to follow 
        their preferred style of jazz or ‘their’ band and this uncertainty further depleted crowd numbers.  
        In April the committee decided to introduce the stability of having the same band play on one of 
        the two jazz nights each month and rotate bands in the other jazz night of each month.  Pacific 
        Mainstream Jazz Band was appointed as the first ‘house band’ and a new program had other bands 
        playing on the 2nd Sunday of the month and PMJB regularly on the 4th Sunday.  This greatly relieved 
        the pressure on the committee, enabled program information to be publicised in advance through the 
        monthly newsletter and attendances began to increase.
        <br><br>
        With the change of venue in 2009 the club made a concerted effort to attract a wider circle of 
        people to the club, predominantly by encouraging all members to introduce at least two new people 
        to the club in that year.  This was another successful attempt by the committee to revive the jazz 
        club and with provided the momentum for other ventures such as the Step OUT-Step UP program 
        designed to give emerging jazz enthusiasts the training and mentorship to step out of the classroom 
        and up onto the stage.   
        <br><br>
        The club continued to hold an annual jazz ball with a change of title to Jazz ‘n Jewels Ball 
        (later changed to Jazz & Jewels Ball) giving patrons the opportunity to dress in their finery 
        and skim the dance floor to the beautiful music of the 22-piece Stokes Nicholson Big Band and a 
        special night close to ANZAC Day to commemorate the post-war era of jazz.  </p>
