<h1>Step OUT Step UP</h1>
<h2>2009 Step OUT- Step UP: a developmental jazz program</h2>
<p>
    In January 2009, the North Queensland Jazz Club received a grant from the RADF (Regional Arts 
    Development Fund) through the Townsville City Council, to conduct Step OUT – Step UP: a program to 
    take emerging jazz musicians and singers out of the classroom and up onto the stage.
    <br><br>
    The concept is to assist musicians and singers to Step OUT of the school systems or the 
    non-professional playing arena and have them Step UP to playing in front of fee-paying audiences. 
    There is a world of difference between playing with school bands or non-professional groups and the 
    nuances of performing with professionals.
    <br><br>   
    The number of competent, professional jazz players in Townsville is small and this program is 
    designed to increase the city’s jazz-playing personnel. 
    <br><br>  
    Auditions were completed in February and the successful applicants were introduced to NQ Jazz Club 
    members and guests on Sunday 8 March 2009. On this night, Counterpoint was the featured band, led by 
    Bob Passmore and the line-up included the mentors from the Step OUT – Step UP program.
    <br><br>
    The mentors were Vicki Salisbury (vocals), David Salisbury (saxophone), Larry Thomson (piano) and Les 
    Nicholson (trumpet).
    <br><br>
    Over the next eight months these leading Townsville jazz musicians mentored and trained the 12 
    successful applicants in the art of singing and playing jazz. As well as attending workshops in 
    improvisation and stagecraft the participants in the program obtained valuable playing experience by 
    sitting in with local jazz bands at professional performances.
    <br><br>
    The participants performed with several different bands at NQ Jazz Club during the course of the year
    which allowed club members and guests the opportunity to see these artists from their performance with 
    Counterpoint at the beginning of the program and watch their progress throughout the year. These keen 
    young musicians also played at the Picnic Bay Life Savers Sunday jazz session and other venues, 
    gaining experience with a variety of jazz bands.
    <br><br>
    Step OUT – Step UP culminated in a special jazz night at the NQ Jazz Club on 8 November 2009 when 
    the program participants played and sang as STEPPING OUT – a newly developed jazz band with its own 
    unique sound, supported by All the President’s Men and their leading lady, Vick Salisbury. </p>
