The site uses underscores as a starter theme with customisations on top of the default appearance.
While underscores default look is mostly blank, it comes with many detailed pre-existing files to make customisation simple. Underscores has a lot of basic functionality already so most of the customisations made were css changes or minor functional additions as needed.

Grunt was used to modify the existing css. style.scss is the sass file used for customisations. This was autogenerated from the existing style.css that came with underscores. Many parts of the css are unused in the final site but were left in since going they don't cause any problems by being there and could be easily changed in the future if needed.

Since some customisation can be done inside wordpress only the most important areas were changed in the css file. This includes the colours and fonts for the all text on the site from headers to links. All headers, buttons and links use Garamond for the font while paragraphs use Georgia. The general colour scheme for the site is primarily black and white. 

The header is set up to display all pages in a list on the right while the logo appears on the left. Both of these can be changed inside wordpress as needed. The footer is left blank but supports widgets and can be customised as needed.
