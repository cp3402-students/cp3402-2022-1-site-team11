Most the of site uses the standard wordpress functions without anything too complex. All pages are pages and top level pages automatically appear in the header menu. Since the site is small they were left uncategorised but that could be done in the future if the site grows large enough to justify. Currently all pages are top level pages but child pages can be used in order to prevent the header menu from getting overcrowded and ot ease navigation.

All forms on the site were created with wpforms and the image galleries on the gallery page were created with nextgen gallery. These plugins are simple to use and new forms/galleries can be added as needed. 

The calendar on the events page is currently hardcoded and needs to be updated manually. An automated version was considered but could not be successfully implemented in time. All other site functions are standard wordpress functions and should not cause any problems when updating the site in the future.
